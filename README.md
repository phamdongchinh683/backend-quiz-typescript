## ðŸš€ Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies.**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start project locally.**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Library

- **Express**:

#### Web Applications

Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.

#### Web APIs

With a myriad of HTTP utility methods and middleware at your disposal, creating a robust API is quick and easy.

#### Performance

Express provides a thin layer of fundamental web application features, without obscuring Node.js features that you know and love.

#### Middleware

Express is a lightweight and flexible routing framework with minimal core features meant to be augmented through the use of Express middleware modules.

- **Typescript**:

#### JavaScript and More

TypeScript adds additional syntax to JavaScript to support a tighter integration with your editor. Catch errors early in your editor.

#### A Result You Can Trust

TypeScript code converts to JavaScript, which runs anywhere JavaScript runs: In a browser, on Node.js or Deno and in your apps.

#### Safety at Scale

TypeScript understands JavaScript and uses type inference to give you great tooling without additional code.

- **Mysql**:

MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS). Its name is a combination of My, the name of co-founder Michael Widenius's daughter My SQL, the acronym for Structured Query Language. A relational database organizes data into one or more data tables in which data may be related to each other; these relations help structure the data. SQL is a language that programmers use to create, modify and extract data from the relational database, as well as control user access to the database.

- **Cors(Cross-origin resource sharing)**:
  a mechanism by which a front-end client can make requests for resources to an external back-end server

#### Why Use CORS?

Security: CORS helps to prevent malicious websites from accessing sensitive information on your server.
Resource Sharing: It allows controlled access to resources on a server from a different origin, enabling web applications to make API requests to external services.
